This repository contains Matlab utility functions.

In order to use these functions clone / download the functions to a folder in your computer and add that folder to Matlab search path.

Look for (File -> Set Path) in Matlab to modify the Matlab search path.

Since each of the Matlab functions are used for different purposes there is no
common _syntax_ associated with them. Also there is no common documentation
explaining the use of each function. Hence please refer to the comments at the
start of each function for its purpose and syntax.
